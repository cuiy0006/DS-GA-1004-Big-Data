These bash scripts are meant to help you debug your programs for HW1. 
Similar tests will be used in grading the assignment. 

Setting up the tester:
0. Recall that for submission, you should have a folder named your_netid, and within that folder, you should have 8 folders, for tasks 1-8. Within each task folder, you should have a map.py and reduce.py file (along with the output specified). 
1. Put the hw1tester.tar file in the same directory where you have the folder named your_netid.
2. Type: tar xvf hw1tester.tar 

You should run the scripts from within this same folder. 
To test all tasks locally (just using python, but not hadoop), type:

./testall_local.sh your_netid

To test all tasks using hadoop, type:

./testall_hadoop.sh your_netid

(Note: you may need to use the full path to your folder instead of just your_netid, i.e., /home/ecc290/hw1/ecc290)

To run individual tasks, you can use the testtask* scripts. Examples:

./testtask_local.sh 1 parking-violations.csv,open-violations.csv your_netid
./testtask_local.sh 2 parking-violations.csv your_netid
./testtask_local.sh 3 open-violations.csv your_netid
./testtask_hadoop.sh 1 /user/ecc290/HW1data/parking-violations.csv,/user/ecc290/HW1data/open-violations.csv your_netid
./testtask_hadoop.sh 4 /user/ecc290/HW1data/parking-violations.csv your_netid

The first parameter is the number of the task you want to test. The second parameter is the input file (for using hadoop, you must use the full file path on HDFS as above). The third parameter is your netid (the name of the folder that contains your code). 

For each task that is run, a ".res" file is created in the results/ folder. This .res file says whether your code passed or failed. 
If your code failed, a ".diff" file is created in the results/ folder, which tells you how the output your code produced differs from the solution key. 

NOTE: As part of the assignment, you must also include output generated by your code using hadoop with the specified number of reducers. These testing scripts do not test whether you have included this output or not.
